### LIVE TABLES (12 — confirmed via Table Editor 22 May)
asset_twins, assets, baselines, bearing_library, case_library,
fault_signatures, knowledge_chunks, nvr_records, organisations,
profiles, subscription_events, usage_log

### SCHEMA DRIFT — IMPORTANT
The committed schema file (axiomanare_schema.sql) and the live DB have diverged.
- Schema file defines 8 tables: organisations, assets, baselines, nvr_records,
  fault_detections, fault_signatures, zone_progressions, bearing_library.
- The 6 "sprint" tables (profiles, asset_twins, case_library, knowledge_chunks,
  usage_log, subscription_events) were created by an UNCOMMITTED migration
  (the 13 Apr "schema.sql utility script") — they exist in prod but are NOT in
  the committed schema file.
- fault_detections and zone_progressions are in the schema FILE but were
  NEVER created in prod. The live DB does not have them.
- Net live state = 6 from schema file (no fault_detections/zone_progressions)
  + 6 from the uncommitted migration = 12 tables.

### profiles columns (confirmed 22 May)
id (uuid PK), org_id (uuid), tier (tier_name enum),
subscription_status (subscription_status enum), stripe_customer_id (text),
stripe_sub_id (text), paypal_sub_id (text), asset_addon_count (int),
analyses_used (int), billing_interval (text), created_at, updated_at,
is_admin (boolean — ADDED 22 May by RLS migration)
- NOTE: the Stripe column is `stripe_sub_id`, NOT `stripe_subscription_id` as
  earlier CONTEXT "pending" items wrongly stated. Both Stripe columns already
  exist in prod — the "ADD COLUMN" pending item is effectively DONE.

---

## RLS — ROW LEVEL SECURITY (hardened 22 May, verified on prod)
Earlier CONTEXT claimed RLS was "hardened and tested." That was INCORRECT — the
live DB carried open "USING (true)" beta policies and organisations was flagged
UNRESTRICTED. This was closed on 22 May by rls_foundation_v2.sql.

### Tenancy model
- Individual AND org based. An individual account = an org of one.
- Every profile points at an org_id. Customer data is org-scoped.
- An admin (profiles.is_admin = true) sees and manages everything.

### What rls_foundation_v2.sql installed (run on prod 22 May, success)
- Added profiles.is_admin boolean default false.
- Two SECURITY DEFINER helpers (SET search_path = public, granted to anon +
  authenticated + service_role):
    current_org_id() -> the caller's org
    is_admin()       -> whether caller is admin
- Column-guard trigger guard_profile_privileged_cols() on profiles BEFORE
  UPDATE: blocks non-admin / non-service_role changes to tier, is_admin, org_id.
  Exempts auth.role() = 'service_role' so the Stripe webhook can still set tier.
- Dropped all legacy open policies; installed org-scoped + admin policies.
- Migration is TABLE-EXISTENCE-AWARE (one DO block) — only touches tables that
  exist, so it matches the drifted live DB and skips fault_detections /
  zone_progressions cleanly.
- WIPED pre-RLS test data (Option A): TRUNCATEd assets/baselines/nvr_records
  (fault_detections absent). Reference/silo data preserved (bearing_library,
  fault_signatures seed).

### Policy counts confirmed on prod (per table)
profiles 4, organisations 4, bearing_library 2, fault_signatures 2,
assets / baselines / nvr_records / asset_twins / case_library /
knowledge_chunks / usage_log / subscription_events = 1 each.

### Access summary
- profiles: own row or admin (privileged cols guarded by trigger).
- organisations: members read; member/admin update; authenticated insert;
  admin delete.
- assets / baselines / nvr_records: org-scoped (baselines & nvr scoped through
  parent asset's org) or admin.
- fault_signatures / zone_progressions (CUMULATIVE SILO, anonymised, shared
  cross-customer by design): authenticated insert + read; admin all.
- bearing_library: ANON READ preserved (free diagnostic needs it); admin write.
- asset_twins / case_library / knowledge_chunks / usage_log /
  subscription_events: ADMIN-ONLY (features not built yet; refine when built).
  RAG reads go via SECURITY DEFINER match fn which bypasses RLS.

### First admin bootstrapped (22 May)
- davidlimyk@gmail.com promoted to is_admin = true.
- NOTE: the console (postgres role) does NOT bypass the column-guard trigger.
  Bootstrap required temporarily disabling the trigger:
    ALTER TABLE public.profiles DISABLE TRIGGER trg_guard_profile_privileged_cols;
    UPDATE public.profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = (...);
    ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE TRIGGER trg_guard_profile_privileged_cols;
- davidlimyk@gmail.com was created via the Subscribe path, so its org_id is
  likely NULL. Fine for an admin (sees all via is_admin()), but note it has no
  org attached.

### handle_new_user trigger — CONFIRMED working
Signup creates an auth.users row AND auto-creates a profiles row (tier=free,
is_admin=false). Verified 22 May with davidlimyk@gmail.com.

### RLS validation method
rls_foundation_v2.sql was validated in a sandbox Postgres 16 against a faithful
12-table replica before running on prod. Behavioural tests passed: cross-org
isolation, self-escalation blocked by trigger, service_role/webhook tier update
works (with BYPASSRLS), admin cross-org visibility, anon bearing_library read
preserved, anon customer-data locked. Two GRANT bugs were caught and fixed in
testing (helpers needed EXECUTE for service_role + anon, not just authenticated)
— this is the validated v2.

## In Progress
- [ ] Admin dashboard (admin.html) — NEXT (RLS foundation now in place)

## Pending — Stripe go-live (code done, not live)
- [x] Supabase profiles stripe columns — DONE (already present, stripe_sub_id)
- [ ] Cloudflare Worker: add 5 secrets (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
      STRIPE_PRICE_PRO, STRIPE_PRICE_FLEET_STARTER, STRIPE_PRICE_FLEET_PRO)
- [ ] Stripe Dashboard: create 4 products + prices, register webhook endpoint
- [ ] Redeploy Worker after adding secrets
- [ ] Test full Stripe flow with sk_test_ keys + card 4242 4242 4242 4242
- [ ] Live error currently seen: "No Stripe Price ID configured for tier: pro"
      (expected until secrets/products exist)

## Known Issues / Corrections (surfaced 22 May)
- [ ] auth.js tierAnalysisLimit() returns 2 for free — STALE, real limit is 5
      (app.js). Reconcile (auth.js line ~76).
- [ ] Pluralisation: badge reads "N free analyses left". "analyses" is correct
      for plural, but at count=1 it should say "1 free analysis". Check
      updateFreeBadge() pluralises (count===1 ? 'analysis' : 'analyses').
- [ ] PRICE RECONCILIATION: Subscribe modal in auth.js shows HARDCODED prices
      (Pro $49, Fleet Starter $99, Fleet Pro $299) even though CONTEXT pricing
      was "deferred/TBD". Stripe products MUST be created with these exact
      prices or displayed vs charged price will disagree.
- [ ] Verify free-flow RLS impact: does the LOGGED-OUT free diagnostic write to
      nvr_records or fault_signatures? Those are now locked to authenticated/
      org-scoped. If the free flow writes there, those writes will fail and need
      a scoped anon exception. Bearing lookup (anon read) is preserved, so the
      core diagnostic should be fine.
- [ ] RLS app-impact: fleet.html/app.js may have relied on old open access.
      First post-RLS stress test is also the test of whether the app respects
      its own RLS.

## Not Started
- [ ] Digital twin Phase 1
- [ ] ML feature extraction (CWRU/NASA)
- [ ] Case library population
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Annual pricing / discount logic
- [ ] PayPal integration (deferred — after Stripe is live)
- [ ] Supabase Storage buckets (ml-raw-signals, knowledge-base)
- [ ] NASA IMS 3rd_test (ZIP corrupt, deferred)
- [ ] KB/Reports: Q1, Q3, Q4 2023 quarterly reports (pending upload)
- [ ] KB/Manuals: CAT 1 manual (pending)
- [ ] CWRU 48 kHz drive end files (deferred)
- [ ] 6205-2RS bearing → add to bearing_library
- [ ] fault_detections / zone_progressions — decide whether to create in prod
      (in schema file, not in live DB; RLS migration skips them)

## Tier Structure
| Tier          | Price   | Analyses  | Assets | AI Report | Fleet |
|---------------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Free          | $0      | 5         | —      | ✗         | ✗     |
| Pro           | $49/mo  | Unlimited | —      | ✓         | ✗     |
| Fleet Starter | $99/mo  | Unlimited | 10     | ✓         | ✓     |
| Fleet Pro     | $299/mo | Unlimited | 30     | ✓         | ✓     |
| Asset add-on  | $25/mo  | —         | +1     | ✓         | ✓     |

- Prices above are HARDCODED in the auth.js Subscribe modal (confirmed live).
  Stripe products/prices must match these exactly.
- No upload caps on any paid tier; gate on assets only.
- Annual: 2 months free (pay 10, get 12) — logic not built.
- AI report is the primary freemium gate.
- Pricing philosophy: below expense claim threshold — engineer pays own card.
- Replaces $200–$1,600/asset desk analysis time, NOT the site visit. Engineer
  reviews + signs off all output. AI report is a draft, not a certified
  determination.

---

## FREEMIUM GATE — Implementation Detail
```
FREE_ANALYSIS_LIMIT = 5 (app.js)
Free tier = anonymous, CLIENT-SIDE (localStorage counter). No Supabase account,
no profiles row. "Free to Try" is NOT a signup.

Freemium.isPro()
  → reads localStorage.ax_tier (written by syncTier())
  → any value other than 'free' returns true
  → ax_pro legacy fallback if ax_tier absent

Freemium.syncTier() [async]
  → called 200ms after auth.js loads (index.html inline script)
  → window.Auth.getTier() → Supabase profiles.tier → caches ax_tier
  → if paid: removes watermark, trial banner, upgrade modal, PDF lock

Auth.getTier() returns profile?.tier || 'free'
  → one of 'pro' | 'fleet_starter' | 'fleet_pro' | 'free' (never null)
```

### FLEET GATING — fleet.html (22 May, behind feature flag)
```
const FLEET_GATING_ENABLED = false   (fleet.html ~line 726)
  → DEFAULT OFF for stress testing — any authenticated user reaches dashboard.
  → Flip to TRUE before launch to enforce fleet-tier-only access.

CRITICAL: fleet.html uses its OWN self-contained auth (raw fetch to
/auth/v1/token, _session + localStorage.ax_session). It does NOT establish a
supabase-js session. So Auth.getTier() (which reads via the supabase-js client)
would floor every fleet user to 'free' and lock out paying subscribers.
THEREFORE fleet gating uses its own getUserTier() — reads profiles.tier via
fleet's bearer-token sbGet, same pattern as loadUserOrg() reading organisations.

When enabled:
  - getUserTier() reads profiles.tier (bearer token, not Auth.getTier())
  - isFleetTier() = fleet_starter | fleet_pro only
  - enforceFleetGate() gates BOTH entry points (fresh login + session restore)
    before showApp()
  - free/pro users → #upgrade-screen overlay (reuses login-card styling),
    CTA opens Auth.openModal('subscribe'), plus sign-out
  - doLogout() also clears the upgrade overlay

OUT OF SCOPE (still open):
  - Asset-count enforcement (Fleet Starter 10 / Fleet Pro 30) — separate from
    access gating, not built.
  - "Upgrade an existing logged-in user" Stripe flow — belongs to Stripe
    go-live; subscribe modal currently does signup-then-checkout.

PRE-LAUNCH (when enabling): flip flag → true; test fleet_starter PASSES, test
pro/free gets BLOCKED — validates the profiles RLS self-read.
```

## Payments
- Stripe: primary (account exists, keys TBC)
- PayPal: secondary (deferred — after Stripe live; paypal_sub_id column exists)
- Currency: USD primary, local via Stripe/PayPal auto
- Billing: monthly auto-renew, cancel anytime
- Products to create in Stripe (with prices above): Pro, Fleet Starter,
  Fleet Pro, Asset Add-on

### RAG Pipeline (live)
```
PDF/MD → chunk → embed (voyage-3, 1024-dim) → knowledge_chunks (pgvector)
→ at analysis: semantic query from NVR context → /embed → /rag → top-5 chunks
  (0.30 similarity floor) → injected into Claude system prompt → grounded report

## Session Log — 22 May 2026 (Ops — cron verify + Gating — fleet + Security — RLS + admin)
```
Completed this session:
  OPS — keep-alive cron verified:
    - Cloudflare Observability showed "keepalive 200 @ 2026-05-19T09:00:11.867Z",
      0 errors, firing at 09:00 UTC. 18 May handoff item closed.

  GATING — fleet.html tier gating (committed):
    - Confirmed Auth.getTier() returns 'pro'/'fleet_starter'/'fleet_pro'/'free'
      (never null).
    - KEY FINDING: fleet.html uses own auth (raw fetch, _session, ax_session) —
      no supabase-js session. Auth.getTier() would lock out paying fleet users.
    - Added getUserTier() (bearer-token sbGet on profiles), isFleetTier(),
      enforceFleetGate(), #upgrade-screen overlay. Gated both entry points.
    - PARKED behind const FLEET_GATING_ENABLED = false (fleet.html ~line 726).
    - Syntax verified (node --check). Commit 0df5503.

  SECURITY — RLS foundation (rls_foundation_v2.sql, run on prod, success):
    - Discovered schema drift: live DB has 12 tables; profiles + 5 others were
      from the uncommitted 13 Apr migration; fault_detections + zone_progressions
      in schema file but NOT in prod. Stripe columns (stripe_customer_id,
      stripe_sub_id) ALREADY present (pending item was already done).
    - Earlier "RLS hardened" claim was FALSE — open USING(true) beta policies
      live, organisations UNRESTRICTED.
    - Added profiles.is_admin. Helper fns current_org_id()/is_admin()
      (SECURITY DEFINER, search_path set, granted anon+authenticated+service_role).
    - Column-guard trigger on profiles (blocks tier/is_admin/org_id changes;
      exempts service_role + admin).
    - Dropped legacy policies; installed org-scoped + admin policies on all 12
      tables. Migration table-existence-aware (skips missing tables).
    - WIPED test data (Option A): TRUNCATE assets/baselines/nvr_records.
    - Validated in sandbox Postgres 16 (12-table replica) before prod: cross-org
      isolation, escalation block, service_role tier update, admin visibility,
      anon bearing read, anon customer-data lock — all pass. Caught + fixed 2
      GRANT bugs (helpers needed service_role + anon execute) — this is v2.
    - Confirmed on prod: policy counts per table correct, organisations no longer
      UNRESTRICTED, is_admin column present.

  ADMIN bootstrap:
    - handle_new_user trigger CONFIRMED firing (davidlimyk@gmail.com signup
      created a profiles row, tier=free).
    - Bootstrapped first admin: davidlimyk@gmail.com → is_admin=true.
      Required DISABLE TRIGGER (console/postgres does NOT bypass the guard).
    - Note: davidlimyk@gmail.com org_id likely NULL (created via Subscribe path).

  CORRECTIONS LOGGED (see Known Issues):
    - auth.js tierAnalysisLimit() still returns 2 (should be 5)
    - badge pluralisation at count=1 ("1 free analysis")
    - prices HARDCODED $49/$99/$299 in modal vs CONTEXT "TBD"
    - verify free-flow writes to nvr_records/fault_signatures under new RLS

Files changed:
  - fleet.html (committed 0df5503)
  - rls_foundation_v2.sql (utility, run on prod — not committed yet)
  - CONTEXT.md (this rewrite)

Latest code commit: 0df5503

Next session should:
  - Build admin.html (admin v1): gate on is_admin(); subscriber list (email,
    tier, status, analyses_used, signup date); actions = set tier + reset
    analysis count. Reuse index.html CSS vars + Auth object. Config-flag editing
    and analytics are v2.
  - Then stress testing (PHASE 1.5): start with anonymous free-flow under RLS
    and the free-flow nvr_records/fault_signatures write check.
  - Commit rls_foundation_v2.sql + this CONTEXT.md to repo.
```
